# GitHub Action Supporting The Camunda Community Extensions Release Process

## Introduction

_Note: Before continuing, we suggest [reading the release process documentation](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/community/blob/main/RELEASE.MD)._

GitHub Actions currently has poor options for code sharing. This means that workflows have to be duplicated across repositories. This has the advantage of highly customizable workflows, on the other hand it makes maintaining workflows painful.

Composite Run Steps have been added to alleviate this shortcoming, as they allow for wrapping multiple shell-only steps into one “pseudo action”. This can either be hosted in the same or a shared repository.

However, those Composite Run Steps [don’t yet allow for using arbitrary actions](https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/646).

This means that things like actions/checkout or actions/setup-java still need to be done individually. However, it is usually those steps that require the most customization anyway.

In order to effectively maintain a large number of repositories, an implementation around centrally maintained Composite Run Steps is favorable, and this repository aims to provide it.

### Security Scanning

The [v1.0.6 release](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/community-action-maven-release/releases/tag/v1.0.6) introduces optional [Trivy Security Scanning](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy), which can be run during the release process contained in this action via a Bash script. When enabled, Trivy scans for security vulnerabilities in container images, file systems, and Git repositories, as well as for configuration issues. To enable the scanner, set the `vulnerability-scan` input default to `true`.

If there are no vulnerabilities found, or `UNKNOWN,` `LOW,` or `MEDIUM` vulnerabilities, the action will complete with `exit 0`. If there is a `HIGH` or `CRITICAL` vulnerability found, the release deployment will fail with `exit 1`. The results of the scan will then be displayed in a `sarif.tpl` named `trivy-results.sarif`.

The [v1.0.7 release](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/community-action-maven-release/releases/tag/v1.0.7) introduces uploading the results of a Trivy vulnerability scan that has completed with `exit 1` contained in a Sarif file to the [GitHub Security](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security) tab.

### Prerequisites

Any project needs to use the [community-hub-release-parent](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/community-hub-release-parent) in their POM:

```xml
<parent>
    <groupId>org.camunda.community</groupId>
    <artifactId>community-hub-release-parent</artifactId>
    <version>1.1.0</version>
</parent>
```

This parent POM contains all necessary settings for the GitHub action to function properly.
